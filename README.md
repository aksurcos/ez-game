Simple, easy-to-use, cliche design for users who want to play nostalgic "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" game. Since the time spent on this project was short due to some unfortunate events, the features in the project are limited and simple. Although it is not usual to explain this, this project is like a design made on top of another project.
